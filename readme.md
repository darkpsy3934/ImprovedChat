Improved Chat by wd1966
=======================

**Improved Chat** is a Minecraft clientside chat mod originally developed by *wd1966*, eventually being maintained by a bunch of other developers.

This fork is maintained by *darkpsy3934* using a CC-BY-SA License Model.  This code-base will be updated to the latest build approximately a week after the release of the latest MCP build.

I'm currently in the process of cleaning up the code and obtaining a Continuous Integration server so the latest builds are always available.  The initial process will be cleaning up the code and fixing bugs that may be present.

This README will be updated with the latest progress at all times.
